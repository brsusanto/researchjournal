left,Yehwhan Song,"South Korean Artist, 1995 - Present","Yehwan Song is a Korean-born web artist currently based in New York City who specialises in creating websites with an unconventional, non-user friendly approach. Within her experiments of breaking conventions of user interaction within web design, Song aims to convey the feelings of discomfort and insercurity felt by marginalised users of the internet, which Song mentions is often hidden behind ""the facade of technological utopianism, marked by excessive comfort, speed, and ease of use.""

“People are trying to make websites more focused on being user friendly. Just making it easy to use, and as ‘good’ as possible,” she laments. “It’s kind of frustrating because they end up only using the same templates, meaning the user can only find where the button is and how to use it.” This oversimplification is something that Yehwan feels is selling people short, and turning the internet into a uniform place.",https://type-01.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Yehwan-Song-TYPE01.3.gif,,"Yehwan Song, Cascading Spiral, 2022",,https://yhsong.com/,"CreativeCoding, Artist", 
left,Can't Help Myself,"Sun Yuan & Peng Yu, 2016","Sun Yuan & Peng Yu are two Chinese conceptual artists who rose into prominence in the late 1990s and formed a partnership in 2000. As collaborators they are known for incorporating unusual textures and organic materials into their work, often crossing various mediums and challenge political and social systems of authority. Their large installations often incorporate technological components to comment critically on the modern understanding and exercise of political constructs like the nation-state, sovereign territory, freedom, and democracy.

In this work commissioned for the Guggenheim Museum, Sun Yuan & Peng Yu employ an industrial robot, visual-recognition sensors, and software systems to examine our increasingly automated global reality, one in which territories are controlled mechanically and the relationship between people and machines is rapidly changing. Placed behind clear acrylic walls, their robot has one specific duty, to contain a viscous, deep-red liquid within a predetermined area. When the sensors detect that the fluid has strayed too far, the arm frenetically shovels it back into place, leaving smudges on the ground and splashes on the surrounding walls. The idea to use a robot came from the artists’ initial wish to test what could possibly replace an artist’s will in making a work and how could they do so with a machine. They modified a robotic arm, one often seen on production lines such as those in car manufacturing, by installing a custom-designed shovel to its front. Collaborating with two robotics engineers, Sun Yuan & Peng Yu designed a series of thirty-two movements for machine to perform. Their names for these movements, such as “scratch an itch,” “bow and shake,” and “ass shake,” reflect the artists’ intention to animate a machine. Observed from the cage-like acrylic partitions that isolate it in the gallery space, the machine seems to acquire consciousness and metamorphose into a life-form that has been captured and confined in the space.",https://www.guggenheim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016.40_ph_web_2.jpg,,"Sun Yuan, Can't Help Myself, 2016",,https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812,"ConceptualArt, InteractiveArt",
left,Candy Box!,"aniwey, 2013","Candy Box! is an incremental online text-based role-playing game that runs in web browser. It was developed by a 19-year-old French student using the pseudonym ""aniwey"" and released in April 2013. Candy Box! uses ASCII art for the visuals.

Particularly notable about the game itself is how deceptively simple the game appears to be. Starting out with a button to click to collect candies, the game eventually unravels itself with a full-fledged map and quests with minigames not unlike a large RPG game, under an appearance of a simple browser game. The depth of the game within what seems to be the average low-power browser game has ended up becoming influential in the sphere of incremental game design, having influence games such as Cookie Clicker.",https://149362454.v2.pressablecdn.com/previously/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/11/candybox2_map_header_1-880x495.jpg,,"Candy Box, 2013",,https://candybox2.github.io/candybox/,Games,

Spambots explores what would happen if, instead, machine learning was used to empower a group of robotic Spam cans to tell their tales. Each Spambot has a small keyboard with four letters on it and when they collaborate they are able type the whole alphabet along with some punctuation. The text they are typing is generated by a neural network fine tuned on a version of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World where occasional words have been swapped out for pig-related ones.

Her large-scale sculptures often employs found objects, plants, photographs, wiring, and food detritus. Sze constructs her work by hand, building intricate and often gravity-defying towers that fill entire exhibition spaces. The organic and transitional state of her work suggests something in the process of growth and decay. “I am aware people might dismiss my art, but I'm interested in getting them to stop and look; for no other reason than that is what I do,” she has reflected. Born in 1969 in Boston, MA, she completed her BA in architecture and painting at Yale University before receiving her MFA from the School of Visual Arts in 1997. Sze is the recipient of the 2003 MacArthur Fellowship, as well as representing the United States at the 2013 Venice Biennale with her work Triple Point.

left,Pulse Topology,"Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, 2021","“Pulse Topology” is composed of thousands of light bulbs suspended at different heights that create a series of crests and valleys—an intimate landscape that visitors are invited to traverse. Each light bulb glimmers to the pulse of a different participant, which contributes to a connective arrangement. Custom-made pulse sensors record visitor heartbeats; when a new participant interacts with the installation, their pulse is added to the canopy of recordings above them, with the newest recording replacing the oldest.

Forming a platform for self-representation, in “Pulse Topology” individual heartbeats come together to form an immersive chorus of light and sound. Translating an interior force to an exterior form, the piece makes tangible the otherwise invisible register of the heartbeat, which glows and then fades in the spirit of a memento mori.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fTBvzR3HREZGv8MMUNUrMD.jpg,,"Pulse Topology, 2021",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zy39kMf_3o,"InteractiveArt, PhysicalComputing",
